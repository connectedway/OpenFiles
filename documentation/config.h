\defgroup config Static Configuration Parameters

These parameters control the build of the Open Files stack.

Openfiles configuration is managed through a set of cmake 
include files.  In order to support flexible configurations, we
group include files as follows:

- platform configurations
- behavior configurations
- debug configurationss
- smb configurations
- cipher configurations
- jni configurations  
- identity configuration
- limit configurations

======================
Platform Configuration
======================

A platform configuration file defines the compile type definitions
required to support the platform.

Openfiles comes preconfigured for the following platforms:

- android armv8: ./build/android_arm64-v8a-platform.cfg
- android armv7: ./build/android_armeabi-v7a-platform.cfg
- android x86_64: ./build/android_x86_64-platform.cfg
- android x86: ./build/android_x86-platform.cfg
- linux arm64 and x86_64: ./build/linux-platform.cfg
- macos arm64 and x86_64: ./build/macos-platform.cfg
- windows x86_64: ./build/win-platform.cfg

Openfiles is easily ported to other platforms.  Any of the above
configuration files can be used as a template for a new platform config.
Connected Way also has other config files for platforms not listed.

======================
Behavior Configuration
======================

A behavior configuration file defines the Open Stack behavior for 
the various platforms.

Openfiles comes preconfigured for the following behaviors.

- android armv8: ./build/android_arm64-v8a-behavior.cfg
- android armv7: ./build/android_armeabi-v7a-behavior.cfg
- android x86_64: ./build/android_x86_64-behavior.cfg
- android x86: ./build/android_x86-behavior.cfg
- linux arm64 and x86_64: ./build/linux-behavior.cfg
- macos arm64 and x86_64: ./build/macos-behavior.cfg
- windows x86_64: ./build/win-behavior.cfg

The default behavior for each platform is specified in the above
configuration files.  These can be modified or used as a template
for other behaviors.

Configuration Item | Example | Description

===================
Debug Configuration
===================

Configurations that govern debug options within Open Files

Openfiles comes preconfigured for the following debug configurations.

- ./build/debug.cfg: Debug Configuration
- ./build/nodebug.cfg: Release Configuration

The default behavior for debug and release configurations is defined
in the above configuration files.  These can be modified or used as a
template for other debug behaviors.

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
OFC_HANDLE_DEBUG | ON/OFF | Build in debug checks for handles

======================
Identity Configuration
======================

Configurations that set the default platform identity.  These
can be overwritten by the persistent runtime configuration file or
though an API.

The identity configuration is defined in:

- ./build/naming.cfg

====================
Sizing Configuration
====================

Configurations that manage sizing of the Open Files stack.  The default
sizing configuration has been qualified as optimal.  You may find a need
to tweak these depending on your specific workloads

The sizing configuration is defined in:

- ./build/sizing.cfg

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
OFC_MAX_HANDLE16 | 100 | Max 16-bit handles (eg. 100)

=================
JNI Configuration
=================

If building with a Java Native Interface for the OpenFiles SMB stack,
there are configuration items required to build in the JNI layer.

The jni configuration is defined in one of the following two configuration
files:

- ./build/jni.cfg: Build with JNI
- ./build/nojni.cfg: Build without JNI

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
OFC_INCLUDE_JNI | ON/OFF | Build a base JNI library
OPENFILES_SMB_JNI | ON/OFF | Build a SMB JNI library

The list of includes are:

==============
SMB Enablement
==============

If building in the SMB support into OpenFiles, there is the enablement
of SMB, and then a separate SMB Configuration.

For enablement, there are three preconfigured files:

- ./build/nosmb.cfg: Do not build in SMB
- ./build/smbclient.cfg: Build in the SMB client
- ./build/smbserver.cfg: Build in the SMB server.  This also includes the SMB
client

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
OF_NETBIOS | ON/OFF | Include Netbios
OFC_DEFAULT_NETBIOS_MODE | OFC_CONFIG_BMODE | Default NetBIOS Mode
OFC_FS_PIPE | ON/OFF| Add Open File Pipe File System

OF_SMB_SERVER | ON/OFF | Include SMB server
OFC_FS_SMB | ON/OFF | Include a SMB Client File System
OFC_KERBEROS | ON/OFF | Include Kerberos Package

The values for `OFC_DEFAULT_NETBIOS_MODE` are one of:
- OFC_CONFIG_BMODE: Broadcast Mode
- OFC_CONFIG_PMODE: Wins Mode
- OFC_CONFIG_HMODE: Wins First, then Broadcast
- OFC_CONFIG_MMODE: Broadcast First, then Wins

`OFC_FS_PIPE` brings in a pipe file system used by Lan Manager applications.
The lan manager applications supported by OpenFiles are 

- srvsvc: Server Services
- wkssvc: Workstation Services

============
SMB Behavior
============

The SMB Behavior is defined in:

- ./of_smb/configs/default.cfg

There are many configuration parameters for the SMB stack.  For the most
part, these are tuning parameters and never need to be changed.  If chaning
one of these, discuss with Connected Way support.

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
SMB_CREDITS_DEFAULT | 32 | Default Credit Request
SMB_CREDITS_REQUEST | 20 | Client Credits to Maintain
SMB_CREDITS_ALLOCATED | 512 | Max Credits that Server Allocates

OFC_TEST_FS_SMB_PATH | | Default Path to store test files for fs smb.
OFC_NTLMV2_TARGET_TIMESTAMP | ON/OFF | Populate target timestamp in NTLM (ON/OFF)

\note
SMB_MAX_REMOTES is for storing persistent remotes.  There is no limit to
the number of remotes that a client can connect to.

\note
OFC_TEST_FS_SMB_PATH can be overridden in runtime configuration

\note
OFC_NTLMV2_TARGET_TIMESTAMP is non standard and allows client/server time 
synchronization during NTLM authentication

====================
Cipher Configuration
====================

When buiding in SMBv3 support, a Cipher needs to be configured.

Available ciphers:

- ./build/gnutls.cfg: Use GnuTLS
- ./build/openssl.cfg: Use OpenSSL
- ./build/mbedtls.cfg: Use MbedTLS

The values in these files select and delect various ciphers

Configuration Item | Example | Description
-------------------|---------|------------
OF_OPENSSL | ON/OFF | Build with openssl
OF_GNUTLS | ON/OFF | Build with gnutls
OF_MBEDTLS | ON/OFF | Build with mbedtls

\note
Only one of OF_OPENSSL, OF_GNUTLS, OF_MBEDTLS should be enabled.

\defgroup runtime Runtime Configuration Parameters

Runtime configuration of the openfiles stack is managed by an XML file.
On Linux platforms, the default xml file is located at the 
`OPEN_FILES_HOME` environment variable.  If that variable is not defined,
the file will be located at `/etc/openfiles.xml`.

To configure a platform, you can modify the default configuration file
for your build (located within `<source>/configs`), or you can
start with the \ref template.xml and configure as necessary.

Lastly, you can bring up the stack without
any configuration file, and statically configure the stack using the
management APIs, and then call \ref ofc_framework_save with a path to
the file you wish to save.
